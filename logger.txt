Welcome to Group011 Of Infoway !!!!!!!!
DOTNET FileOperations Performance !!!!!!!!
we create file by giving path on program... 
 then we check if file is already created or not ..if not 
 then we createnew txt file
 and then we write some thing on that..after command 
 second writealltext  it will override the previous 
 text for solving that issue we use
 appendalltext and then all the string are
 save on file which we are created.. !!!!!!!!
